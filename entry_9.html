    Dear to whoever has written me a letter. I hope you are doing well. I feel as if although I receive so many letters from so many people and reread them until the paper crumbles, I am quite terrible at writing back. I never know what to write. Words that have been written in letters have impacted me in ways no other medias ever have. I don't think I can do the same. I wish i could write something half as profound and half as emotional. But instead I am spitting out words that will probably get lost sooner or later. But I just wanted to say, thank you for the letter. I love you more than words can describe. You have made me both laugh and cry. Not just from the letter but in person. Your written words are constant reminders that i will be okay. Even if we are far apart, we are connected. With pieces of paper and scribbled words.

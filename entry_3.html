	<p>Letters from my mom come in various forms. She would write me notes on the most random places (like...blank sheets of A4 paper) But those notes have more value to me than anything because they come from her. However, I have to say, she is much more of a texter than a writer. She would always create photo albums of of me when I was younger and send them to me through online and that was her way of storing memories.  </p>


	<p>My mom is someone who i have created the most memories with. I rarely go on vacation or take trips with people but she is the one person i would willingly get myself out of bed and pack my suitecase full for. My favorite place that i have ever visited with her is her hometown hiroshima. One of the first vacation memories i have with her was the summer of 2010 when we visited an island close to mainland hiroshima. The island was home to many cicadas, summer festivals, fisherman and fireworks. I haven't gone back since. Maybe i should one day.</p>

	<p id="secondparagraph">うちの母は、一番たくさん思い出を作ってきた人なんだ。あんまり旅行とかタイプだけど、母となら、わざわざ早起きしてスーツケースに荷物詰めて出かけたいって思えるんだよね。母と一緒に行った場所で一番好きなのは、母の故郷の広島かな。覚えてる中で最初の旅行の思い出は、2010年の夏に広島の近くの島に行ったこと。その島はセミがいっぱいで、夏祭りや漁師さんたち、花火があったんだ。それからまだ一度も戻ってないけど、いつかまた行ってみたいな。</p>
